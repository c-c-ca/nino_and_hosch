This style of programming is referred to as defensive programming.  It does
not clearly delineate client and server responsibilities and implicitly
sanctions the use of exceptions to determine the state of an object.  It
leads to a style in which the only way to determine an object's state is to
depend on an exception.  This is a misues of exceptions to detect normal,
rather than exceptional, conditions.
