The method specification for removeRange in the definition for the
abstract class java.util.AbstractList can be divided into 3 sections:
1. the expected behavior/functionality of the method
   (i.e. preconditions and postconditions)
2. where calls to this method occur throughout the class definition
   (i.e. in other method implementations)
3. implementation level details for the method itself


This first section is information that is relevant to the client.  This
describes the effect of calling the method on an AbstractList and the meaning
and types associated with the parameters fromIndex and toIndex.  This
essentially states the preconditions and postconditions of the contract
between server and client.

The next two sections are intended exclusivley for subclasses.  This
includes explicitly stating where this method is called in the implementation
for AbstractClass (e.g. this method is called by the clear method). And also
how the method itself is implemented (i.e. by getting a list iterator and
repeatedly calling ListIterator.next and ListIterator.remove).
