Common properties between a class modeling students in a university registration system
and a class modeling students in a university library: name and contact information,
such as address and phone number.

It would be possible to have a singel object represent a student for both purposes, but
some properties that belong to the student in one system would be extraneous in another.
That is, while the GPA and class status of a student may be important in a university
registration system, it isn't necessary to have this information in the university
library system.
