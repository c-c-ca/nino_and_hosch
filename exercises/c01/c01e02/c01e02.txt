One possiblity for the type that may be used to serve as the type associated with the
setting property is type int.

One possible query may include currentSetting, which will return the current setting
for the lamp (i.e. whether it is currently off, set to low, medium, or high).

One possible command may include changeSetting, which rotates the lamp's state through
all four of its possible states.  That is, a call to changeSetting will change the 
lamp's setting property to low if it's setting is set to off before the method call.
