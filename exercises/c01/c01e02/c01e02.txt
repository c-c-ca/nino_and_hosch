One possiblity for the type that may be used to serve as the type associated with the
setting property is type int.

One possible query may include setting, which will return the current setting
for the lamp (i.e. whether it is currently off, set to low, medium, or high).

One possible command may include change, which rotates the lamp's setting through
all four possible settings sequentially.  That is, a call to setting will change
the lamp's setting property to low if it's setting is set to off before the method call.
