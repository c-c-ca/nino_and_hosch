In Java, there are various representations for integer literals that can be used to
express the same value.  To express an integer literal in its octal representation,
it must be preceded by a 0.  The integer literal used when attempting to open the
lock, however, is not preceded by any characters and is therefore in its decimal
representation.  In this case, the equivalent decimal representation of an integer
literal that is expressed as 023 is 19, which explains the behavior of the lock.
