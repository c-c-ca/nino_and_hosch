In Java, there are various representations for the same integer literal.  To express 
an integer literal in its octal representation, it must be preceded by a 0.  The value
used when attempting to open the lock, however, is not preceded by a 0 and is therefore
in its decimal representation.  In this case, the equivalent decimal representation of
an integer that is 023 in octal is 19, which explains why the lock is opened when open
is called with a value of 19.
