Assert statements can be used to verify query postconditions, but writing this is
not much different than saying "I don't trust myself to write correct code, but
I do trust myself to write and test a correct postcondition."  For this reason,
verifying preconditions is much more common than verify postconditions.  That is,
the result may be verified before returning the value to the user, but this issue
should be dealt with by implementing the method correctly and in  accordance with
the contract.
