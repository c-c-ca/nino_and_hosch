To design this new game, we cannot use the class Explorer as it currently exists.
For instance, the suggestion of a deficit tolerance is a violation of a class
invariant.

Modifications will need to be made to the documentation for the takeThat method
to explain what calling the method with a negative argument means (i.e. the
notion of a magic tolerance-giving hit) and remove the post-condition that
tolerance will be greater than or equal to zero after the method has completed
execution.
