Given that the ordering implemented by compare is (1) anti-symmetric,
(2) transitive, and (3) holds that two equal elements are equivalent
we may assume that

1.  areRelated is anti-symmetric

        if order.compare(x,y) == 0, then order.compare(y,x) == 0

2.  areRelated is transitive

        if order.compare(x,y) == 0 and order.compare(y,z) == 0,
            then order.compare(x,z) == 0

3.  equality implies equivalence

        if x.equals(y), then order.compare(x,y) == 0

In other words, order.compare(x,y) == 0 is an equivalence and, therefore,
areRelated is also an equivalence.
